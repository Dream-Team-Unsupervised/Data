# Unsupervised Predict Data

This repo contains data provided by Explore Data Science Academy for model building in the Unsupervised sprint. Explore Data Science Academy
acquired the data as per source. The data for the MovieLens dataset is maintained by the GroupLens research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Additional movie content data was legally scraped from IMDB

This dataset consists of several million 5-star ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service.
